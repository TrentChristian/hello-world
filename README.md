# hello-world
First GitHub repository
Hi, 
My name is Trent and I became interested in coding in school a few years ago. The last year I got back into it and have since learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, SQL, and of course Git. I'm excited to learn more and begin working on projects here on GitHub!
